## Running

This has only been tested on Windows, but may also work on other platforms.

Make sure [just](https://www.github.com/casey/just) and Odin are installed.

Then clone and run using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pes18fan/pong.git
cd pong
just
```

If you don't have just, then run it straight from Odin:

```bash
odin run pong/
```
